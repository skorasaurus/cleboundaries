=============


Various City of Cleveland boundary files that aren't publicly available although they should be. 

Inspired by many things including [WNYC's Redistricting map](http://project.wnyc.org/nyc-districting-revised/index.html?lat=40.7370&lon=-73.9220&zoom=12)

For data where I didn't specify the license, I don't what know it is (I didn't make the data set), assume your own risk.

January 2014.

These boundaries were obtained from the City of Cleveland's Planning Department. 


Changes to Cleveland's ward boundaries were first proposed in March 2013 in Cleveland City Council but were later amended
to what was passed in April 2013 and went into effect January 2014.
