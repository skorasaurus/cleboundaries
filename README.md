The City of Cleveland ward boundaries. I will attempt to keep them up to date. 

Inspired by:

2014wardboundaries.osm
The Boundaries were passed by City Council in April 2014. 

2014wardboundaries.shp 
Same as 2014wardboundaries.osm as a SHP. 

2014wardboundaries.geojson
Same as 2014wardboundaries.osm as geojson. 

Proposed Boundaries for 2014 were first released in March 2013. Through City Council deliberations, they were changed before they became official and passed into law. You can find these boundaries by viewing my commit history, specifically the .osm files.

To reproduce on your computer, you can simply change the layer source from a POSTGIS database (generated by osm2pgsql) that I had used, to the geojson or shp included in this repo.

- simple html page using mapbox.js/leaflet that displays the borders over a mapbox basemap.
